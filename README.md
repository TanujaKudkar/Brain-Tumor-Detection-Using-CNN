# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN
Design a CNN model to detect whether the MRI has a brain tumor or not.

# Aim:
The main goal of this project is to design efficient automatic brain tumor detection technique with high acuracy, performance using CNN.

# About the dataset:
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains total 3000 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

# Part 1: Data Split
The data was split in the following way:
70% of the data for training, i.e. 1050 positive and 1050 negative examples, resulting in 2100 images.
15% of the data for validation, i.e. 225 positive and 225 negative examples, resulting in 450 example images.
15% of the data for testing, i.e. 225 positive and 225 negative examples, resulting in 450 example images.

# Part 2: Data Preprocessing


# Part 3: CNN architecture that I've built:

# Results:
The model was trained for 24 epochs. The best validation accuracy was achieved on the 23rd iteration.

# Conclution:

Hope this helpsðŸ™‚.
Thank you!
