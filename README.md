# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN

# Aim:
The main goal of this project is to design CNN model to accurately identify the abnormal tumor region in MRI.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains total 3000 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 1500 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

# Part 1: Data Split
The data was split in the following way:
70% of the data for training, i.e. 1050 positive and 1050 negative examples, resulting in 2100 images.
15% of the data for validation, i.e. 225 positive and 225 negative examples, resulting in 450 example images.
15% of the data for testing, i.e. 225 positive and 225 negative examples, resulting in 450 example images.

# Part 2: Data Preprocessing
Keras's  'ImageDataGenerator' class ensures that model receives new variation of training images at each epoch by applying random transformation.
I've use different transformation techniques like rescaling, zooming, horizontal_flip, nearest filling for training dataset.
I've set batch size = 16 . This will reduce overall memory usage.
'flow_from_directory' method allows to read the images directly from directory and augment them while network model is learning on training images.
For testing dataset, I've set batch size = 1, because in real life scenario, we process 1 image at a time.

# Part 3: CNN architecture that I've built:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the deep learning technique to perform image classification. The Keras library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN. The model type that I have used is Sequential. ‘add()’ function is used to add multiple deep layers to CNN architecture. 24 in the first layer and 64 in the second layer, 128 in the third layer are the number of nodes in each layer. I have set Kernel size = 3 (i.e. 3x3 filter matrix) 

Computers see images using pixels. Pixels in images are usually related. A convolution multiplies a matrix of pixels with a filter matrix or ‘kernel’ and sums up the multiplication values. Then the convolution slides over to the next pixel and repeats the same process until all the image pixels have been covered.





# Results:
The model was trained for total 51 epochs. The best validation accuracy was achieved on the 44th iteration.

Training Accuracy  : 96.52%     Training loss  : 0.105923
Validation Accuracy: 97.11%     Validation loss: 0.125594



Hope this helps🙂. Don't forget to add star.
